'''simple encode decode w/ private key, based on the base64 encode and decode.

Initially developed for turning database ID's into URL's without exposing the
ids in the url, or having a bot iterate over the values.

Also useful for storing passwords which need to be converted back to
clear text, in alphanumeric form given a secret word. This is NOT encryption
nor a hash. This is NOT cryptographically safe. For that an SSL public/private
key pair is preferred. For situations where the encoded string is already
protected by a privileged account, and the secret key is stored in a
configuration file which is also protected by a privileged login, this system
is secure. It is secure by virtue of having all its elements secure, and
mitigates the risk of compromise of either one of those vectors (but not both).

This is good for websites which store the secret key in a configuration file
on disk, and the encoded word in a database (accessible by a different user),
and where both values are not in transactional memory except for the duration
of decoding and using the decoded string, which should be immediate.

    '''safely encode a string given a secret key. This is not encryption as
    the same key is used for encoding and decoding, nor is it a hash as it is
    decodable. The word to be encoded is padded out with random data to
    the length of the secret key (longer keys are better). The returned string
    is even longer, and limited to alphaneumeric characters; perfect for
    storing in text files, urls, csv files, etc.

    for django DB id's use 'encode(str(id), django.config.settings.SECRET_KEY)'

    if being used for perminent URL's which do not change with successive
    calls to encode, a secret key of length 5 should be used, instead of
    the django secret key. This is safer as the encode call will always
    give the same result for a given input instead of padding out with data
    which could give away the pre-encoded data length.

    WARNING: This only works for strings shorter than 1000 characters.
